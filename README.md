A basic react app that fetches NFT data from an endpoint which in this case is openseaAPI. Take-home assignment..!

Features:

- Built a basic frontend view which is also responsive on mobile devices
- Used React-Router
- Used Axios
- Used React Hooks - useState, useEffect
- Implemented pagination for product list (5 products per page)
- Created a filter sidebar

NOTE

- There is no endpoint for fetching collections made available, but I was able to populate list of categories using a dummy data
- Openers api does not return prices and ratings of assets
- Implemented the code for sorting
