A basic react app that fetches NFT data from an endpoint which in this case is openseaAPI. Take-home assignment..! https://nft-marketplace-psi-navy.vercel.app/

Features:

- Built a basic frontend view which is also responsive on mobile devices
- Used React-Router
- Used Axios
- Used React Hooks - useState, useEffect
- Implemented pagination for product list (5 products per page)
- Created a filter sidebar
- Handled different errors
- Implemented search functionality
- Created a details page

NOTE

- The opensea api is limited as when fetching for assets under collections, it doesn't return the price and ratings.
- But I still went ahead to implement the code to handle the sorting, categories, and filters using dummy data.
